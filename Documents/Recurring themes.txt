RECURRING THEMES:

	1) Colour code the keys/guards/doots etc. (Or give some way of showing relationships between them)

	2) Guards can use any lever

	3) Controls: Keep a consistent 'Action' button.
	   Controls: Give some way of telling the player which button the 'Action' button is. 

	4) Levels became too complex too quickly

	5) Extra player feedback: Sounds for unlocking doors, charges, etc. 	

	6) Add more charges, currently the margin of error is too large.
